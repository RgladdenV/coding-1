# In python




# To give a variable a value

name = 'Rob' # The equal sign is the operator
willItSnow = True
numberOfSandwiches = 10

# Comparison operators
# comparisons operators allow us to evaluate data based on several factors

10 > 10 # Is 10 less than 20

20.34 >=0 # is 20.34 greater than or equal to 0

100 == 100 # is 100 the SAME AS 100

100 != 10 # is 100 NOT the SAME as 10

# Arithmatic Operators
# the arithmic operators allow us to perform math with- specifically with the integer and float data types

10 + 10 # addition
12-2 # subtraction
10 * 8 # multiplication
2/1 # division

# Assignment operators
# assignment operators use some combination 

# Logical Operators
# we use logical operators to evaluate if data is true or false

password = '123'
securityQuestion = 'Franks'

# and - used to compare to conditions that are both true

# if both conditions below are true, you will have the value of true
password == '123' and 4 == mathAnswer
# or - used to compare conditions. But only one needs to be true in order for the output to be true.

# not - used to compare conditions BUT will output the opposite result- meaning if two things are true we are going to get false

# whatever the real result is, will become the opposite
not(password == '123' and 2+2 == mathAnswer)
